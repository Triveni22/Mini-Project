                                                             SIMPLE CALENDAR



INTRODUCTION


* This mini project on Calendar in C programming language is a console application without graphics. To make the calendar look colorful, many windows properties have been used in this project. Besides the color used in backgrounds, the days of the month are white and the vacations (Sundays) are indicated using the red foreground color. In this mini project, you can find out the day corresponding to a given date and view the days and dates corresponding to a particular month+year. Basically three operations can be done in this calendar application. To find out the day corresponding to a given date, the date, month and year are asked. You can list the days and dates of any month of any year. For example, entering 04 2014 (April 2014) will give you an output.

* The functions used in the source code are simple and easy to understand. The ones listed below have been used to produce background with color effects. They are described in the source code with comments.

1.void SetColor(int ForgC)
2.void ClearConsoleToColors(int ForgC, int BackC)
3.void SetColorAndBackground(int ForgC, int BackC)
