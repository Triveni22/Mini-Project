# SIMPLE CALENDAR
# INTRODUCTION
 A calendar is a system of organizing days. This is done by giving names to periods of time, typically days, weeks, months and years. A date is the designation of a single, specific day within such a system. A calendar is also a physical record (often paper) of such a system. A calendar can also mean a list of planned events, such as a court calendar or a partly or fully chronological list of documents, such as a calendar of wills.

The functions used in the source code are simple and easy to understand. The ones listed below have been used to produce background with color effects. They are described in the source code with comments.

                         1.void SetColor(int ForgC)
                         
                         2.void ClearConsoleToColors(int ForgC, int BackC)
                         
                         3.void SetColorAndBackground(int ForgC, int BackC)
