## SIMLPLE CALENDAR


## Introduction:-
Simple Calendar is a hugely customizable, offline calendar app free for Android mobile phones designed to do exactly what an android personal tiny calendar should do in 2020. It is a really flexible calendar with many event related options. It offers powerful repetition rules, optional CalDAV synchronization, ics file handling and much more. A power customization feature of Simple Calendar is the ability to tweak the contents of each event appearing inside a calendar. In this way you can display the most important information about your events and highlight whatâ€™s important to your visitors. We highly recommend that you keep your version of WordPress current, but we generally support a couple versions back as long as the latest security patches have been applied.
