# Railway Management System 


# Introduction:-
Railway  Reservation  System  consists  of   various  details  of  different  trains  and  its  i.e.,  Train  Name , Train  Number , Passengerâ€™s  Names & PNR  Numbers.  So  all  these  names  and  numbers  are  to  be  sorted  using  Bubble  Sort,  Insertion  Sort,  Selection Sort  and Quick  Sort.  Firstly,  we  take  50  details  for  each  train  and  develop  a  pseudo code  from  the  algorithm  to  sort  the train  details  accordingly.  We  need  to arrange  and  store  all  the values  in  an  array  data  structure.  Now  the  pseudo   code needs  to  be developed  into  a  C  Program. We  need  to  run  and  test  it  with  different   Train  details,  check  for  errors  and  fix  them.  

The first module is to implement sorting of train numbers using the bubble sort. Second module is to implement sorting of train names using selection sort algorithm. Third module is to implement sorting of passenger names (travelling in a train) using insertion sort algorithm. Fourth module is to implement implement sorting of PNR numbers using quick sort algorithm. So we need to sort all the above details using the respective sorting techniques.
