# Railway Management System 

# Introduction:-

## What is Railway Management System ?
In Railway Management System, we need to sort the various train details into a particular order in order to maintain it in a organised form. So firstly we take all the input details required from the passengers and then sort all the details accordingly. First module includes sorting train numbers using bubble sort. Second module includes sorting train names using selection sort. Third module includes sorting passenger names using insertion sort. And last module includes sorting PNR numbers using quick sort.

## Objectives Of Project:-

The purpose of this project is to develop “Railway Management System” which takes all the customer details and travel details as input and sorts all the information using various sort to arrange them in an organized manner.
This code is basically written as a solution to the drawbacks of existing problems of arranging things in a particular order. This application can be used as a real world application and by any organization.

# Benefits
Railway Management System enables the customer details and travel details as input and sorts all the information using various sorts to arrange them in an organized manner.

# Effective Management
This system is effective, saves time of management. Thus, it saves organization resources and expenses.

# Explanation:-
  ## Railway Management has some features.

Management selects the case which they want(Case 1: Train numbers using Bubble Sort Algorithm Case 2:Train names using Selection sort algorithm, Case 3: passenger names using Insertion Sort algorithm, Case 4: PNR numbers using Quick Sort algorithm)the train details are sorted according to selected case
